	abstract = {
	This paper reviews some of the difficulties that arise in the verification
	of kernelized secure systems and suggests new techniques for their
	resolution. It is proposed that secure systems should be conceived as
	distributed systems in which security is achieved partly through the
	physical separation of its individual components and partly through the
	mediation of trusted functions performed within some of those components.
	The purpose of a security kernel is simply to allow such a 'distributed'
	system to actually run within a single processor; policy enforcement is
	not the concern of a security kernel. This approach decouples verification
	of components which perform trusted functions from verification of the
	security kernel. This latter task may be accomplished by a new 
	verification technique called 'proof of separability' which explicitly 
	addresses the security relevant aspects of interrupt handling and other 
	issues ignored by present methods.
